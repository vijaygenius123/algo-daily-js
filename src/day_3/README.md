# Fizz Buzz (Easy)
Good afternoon, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

Fizz Buzz is a classic interview question that apparently many experienced engineering candidates often can't solve! Let's cover it today.

We're given a number in the form of an integer n.

Write a function that returns the string representation of all numbers from 1 to n based on the following rules:

If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".

If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".

If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuzz".

If it's neither, just return the number itself.

As such, calling fizzBuzz(15) would result in '12fizz4buzzfizz78fizzbuzz11fizz1314fizzbuzz'.

The following image provides a visual of how we processed the input:


## Constraints
Maximum value of Integer n <= 1000
n will always be a positive integer, but can be 0
Expected time complexity : O(n)
Expected space complexity : O(1)

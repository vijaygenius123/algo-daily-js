# Is An Anagram (Easy)
Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

Here's the definition of an anagram: a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another: such as cinema, formed from iceman.

We are given two strings like "cinema" and "iceman" as inputs. Can you write a method isAnagram(str1, str2) that will return true or false depending on whether the strings are anagrams of each other?

## Constraints
Length of both the strings <= 100000
The strings will contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z , A-Z, 0-9)
The strings can be empty
Expected time complexity : O(nlogn)
Expected space complexity : O(n)

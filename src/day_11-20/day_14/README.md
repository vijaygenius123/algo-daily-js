# Find First Non-Repeating Character (Medium)
Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

You're given a string of random alphanumerical characters with a length between 0 and 1000.

Write a method to return the first character in the string that does not repeat itself later on.


So if we had a string input of "asdfsdafdasfjdfsafnnunl'", we can see there are multiple letters that are repeated.

Executing firstNonRepeat('asdfsdafdasfjdfsafnnunl') should return 'j' since it's the first letter where there is no duplicate.

## Constraints
- The given string can be empty
- The string will only contain lowercase/uppercase alphabets and numerals
- Expected time complexity : O(n)
- Expected space complexity : O(A) where A is the number of ASCII characters

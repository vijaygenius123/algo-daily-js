# Sum All Primes (Medium)
Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

You're given a number n. Can you write a method sumOfAllPrimes that finds all prime numbers smaller than or equal to n, and returns a sum of them?


For example, we're given the number 15. All prime numbers smaller than 15 are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

They sum up to 41, so sumOfAllPrimes(15) would return 41.

## Constraints
- n will always be a non zero positive integer <= 100000
- Expected time complexity : O(nlogn)
- Expected space complexity : O(n)

# Detect Substring in String (Medium)
Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

How would you write a function to detect a substring in a string?


If the substring can be found in the string, return the index at which it starts. Otherwise, return -1.

```js
function detectSubstring(str, subStr) {
  return -1;
}
```
Important-- do not use the native String class's built-in substring or substr method. This exercise is to understand the underlying implementation of that method.

# Constraints
 - Length of both the given strings <=100000
 - The strings would never be null
 - The strings will only consist of lowercase letters
 - Expected time complexity : O(n)
 - Expected space complexity : O(1)

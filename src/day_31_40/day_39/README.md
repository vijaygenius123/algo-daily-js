Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

You may see this problem at Autodesk, Indeed, Linkedin, Atlassian, Uber, Quora, Hashicorp, Tanium, Automation Anywhere, Pipedrive, Appian, Veeam, and Nasdaq.

Given an unsorted array of integers, can you write a method maxProductOfThree(unsorted: array) to find the largest product from three of the numbers? For example, given the following array:
```js
[-1, 9, 22, 3, -15, -7]
```

The largest product of three numbers is 2310. This results from -15 * -7 * 22.

## Constraints
- Length of the array <= 100000
- The array will contain values between -1000 and 1000
- The final answer would always fit in the integer range
- Expected time complexity : O(n)
- Expected space complexity : O(1)

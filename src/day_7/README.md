# Majority Element (Easy)
Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

Suppose we're given an array of numbers like the following:

[4, 2, 4]

Could you find the majority element? A majority is defined as "the greater part, or more than half, of the total. It is a subset of a set consisting of more than half of the set's elements."

Let's assume that the array length is always at least one, and that there's always a majority element.

In the example above, the majority element would be 4.


## Constraints
- Length of the array <= 100000
- The array will always contain integer values between -1000000000 and 1000000000
- Expected time complexity : O(n)
- Expected space complexity : O(n)

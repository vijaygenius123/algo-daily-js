# Find the Intersection of Two Linked Lists (Medium)
Good morning, vijaygenius123! Here's our prompt for today.

Assume you have a Linked List implementation that has the following API:

```js
// prepend to start of list
#prepend(val);

// appends to end of list
#append(val);

// get an array of node values (for testing)
#toArray();
```
Can you write a method getIntersection(list1, list2) to find the intersection of two linked lists?


The return value should be a new linked list.

## Constraints
- Length of the two linked lists <= 1000
- The nodes in the list will always contain integer values between -1000000000 and 1000000000
- Expected time complexity : O(n*m) (the lengths of the two lists)
- Expected space complexity : O(n)
